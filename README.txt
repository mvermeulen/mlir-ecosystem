Recipes and pointers for building end-to-end ecosystems.

These are mostly pointers to existing repos, but also then contain scripts
and documents I use for my own experimentation.

miopen-mlir - build of AMD's MIOpen dialect and tests.
onnx-mlir   - the ONNX project to create MLIR
torch-mlir  - export from Pytorch into MLIR
